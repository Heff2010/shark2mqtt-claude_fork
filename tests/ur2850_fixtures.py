"""Shadow fixtures for a UR2850ZEUS (vacuum + mop, Skegox backend).

REAL samples are copied from sanitized bridge DEBUG "Shadow values" lines
(2026-11-04), reduced to the properties the state logic reads. Values are
verbatim; room and floor IDs were replaced with placeholders.

SYNTHETIC samples are states missing from the retained logs. They are built
from the same format, with the values observed and written up in the
wrapper fork's docs/dev/DEVICE_FINDINGS.md. Each is marked SYNTHETIC.
